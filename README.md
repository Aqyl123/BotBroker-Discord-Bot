A simple Discord bot using BotBroker's API to gather price information for all bots and groups available on their site

GET STARTED:
- Get your Discord Bot Token from https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Paste your Discord Bot Token on `Line 64`
- Commands for the bot can be found in the `!help` command.
- Make sure your discord.py version is up to date.

Use `python botbroker.py` to start

- MAJOR load time improvements over 92% faster
- Compiled all bots into one file

IN PROGRESS (11/18/20):
