# BotBrokerBot

Made by Aqyl#0093

A simple Discord bot using BotBroker's API to gather price information for all bots and groups available on their site

GET STARTED:
- Get your Discord Bot Token from https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Paste your Discord Bot Token on `Line 64`
- Commands for the bot can be found in the `!help` command.

Use `python botbroker.py` to start

UPDATE (7/21/20):
- Added cloudscraper to replace the requests module, program sleeps for 5s to avoid anti-bot protection.
