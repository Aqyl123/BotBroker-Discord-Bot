# BotBrokerBot

Made by Aqyl#0093

A simple Discord bot using BotBroker's API to gather price information for all bots and groups available on their site

GET STARTED:
- Get your Discord Bot Token from https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Paste your Discord Bot Token on `Line 64`
- Commands for the bot can be found in the `!help` command.
- Make sure your discord.py version is up to date.

Use `python botbroker.py` to start

UPDATE (7/21/20):
- Added cloudscraper to replace the requests module, program sleeps for 5s to avoid anti-bot protection.

IN PROGRESS (7/21/20):
- Working on a rewrite to better adapt to the API
- Load time improvements
- Overall bug fixes
